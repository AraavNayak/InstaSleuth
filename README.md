# InstaSleuth

Wanna unfollow your unfollowers?

Look no further. This program gives you a list of accounts you don't follow back and accounts who don't follow you back on Instagram. This project utilizes Instagram API and GraphQL to fetch followers/followings, and uses basic IO to compare the contents of two lists (followers and followings) and finally outputs the result.

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<h6>First change the username in <code>obtainLists.js</code> and <code>trueCount.js</code> to the username of the account you want to run this program on, and then go to Instagram and paste and enter the content of <code>obtainLists.js</code> into the console and then enter copy(followers).
